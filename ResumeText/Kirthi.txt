ACADEMIC PROJECTS: 
IOT Node programming: Using Core JAVA  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

      Spring 2018 

•  Developed a communication protocol using TCP/IP socket programming to implement communication between fog nodes (servers) on 

distributed systems which acts as a layer before interacting with cloud. 

Integrated DDOS and TTL Attack on the Domain Name System (DNS) – Using C, Virtual Box, Wireshark, LINUX                                      Spring 2017 

• 

Configured DNS Server, Attacked system, host system. Poisoned the DNS cache by spoofing the IP address to redirect the u ser to a malicious 
webpage and also changed the TTL value. We used Wireshark to sniff and examine the DNS Response packet. 

IP Mobility Support – Using Core Java: Socket Programming     

   

   

   

   

                                              Spring 2017 

• 

Created a client socket and server socket to connect to a remote host, send and receive data, close a connection, bind to a p ort, listen to 
incoming data, accept remote connections to port. The Mobile IP protocol was designed and implemented. 

Improving the quality of security in SDN using Floodlight Controller-Using Wireshark, Mininet, VMware, Java 

 

 

  Fall 2016 

•  Used the method of deep packet inspection which is performed as a firewall feature to manage and avoid the malicious traffic, thus ensuring 

the security of the packet flow. 

Batch Processor – Using Core Java and XML    

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

                   Fall 2016 

•  Developed Java based parsing code for processing the XML files directly into existing hierarchy of Java domain objects. The XML 

files contain commands, which execute as a process and communicate using files or pipes.
